# exploratory-data-analysis---customer-loans-in-finance271

The aim of the project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on loans_payment database and gain deeper understanding of the data by identifying any patterns that could exist, identifying  and correcting issues found (such as missing or incorrectly formatted data), applying statistical techniques to gain insight on the data's distribution, apply visualisation techniques to identify patterns and trends and finally present the results in a understandable and concise manner. 

Installation Instructions: Download the loan_payments database from the remote AWS RDS server using the credentials.yaml (file stored in the locally and ignored by GitHub) and running commands written in the db_utils.py file and then store the downloaded database locally for easy access.
